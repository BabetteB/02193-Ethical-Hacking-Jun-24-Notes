# Introduction

## Cyber attacks and the kill chain (by Lockheed-Martin)
 1. Reconnice
  - Info about the system 
 2. Weponize
 3. Delivery
 4. Exploit
 5. Installation
   - small malware system
 6. Command & control
   - communicate to outside system that the malware is installed
 7. Action
 8. (Exfiltration)
   - e.g. data breaches
 9.  (Money)
   - e.g. ransomware


## Exam report 
Chapter for each day - what did we learn 
data breach is a big chunk


## Ethical Hacking
hacking is often a crime - how can it be ethical 
 - motivation is to protect something
 - end goal is for the good
 - ethics is seen as moral philosofy - different definitions exists
 - maybe legal or illegal/ good or evil 

### Normative Ethics
- "if we create more hapiness then we are ethical"
- happiness is a type of value we can create
- does distribution count / "amount" of hapiness 
- result of the action or 
- maybe you dont fully understand the effect and didn't create value, but you had good intensions - is that ethical?

Consequencetialism : is the result good, maximizing hapiness
Deontology : ethical behaviour / rules we should live by
  - Kant: follow ways of doing something that could be universal laws (hvis alle bare gjorde som jeg så går det nok til sidst)
Virtue Ethics : why are we doing it - is it for the right reasons

### Ethical dilemmas
- the trolly bus problem / the trolly bus bridge problem
- how do we see the situation and what would be ready to do our self

- is it okay to attack a system without their knowledge
  - what if ...


### Ecthical Hackers
- What hat (black <-> white)

## Security Conpects
CIA Triangle
- Confidentiality - proctection
- inte - cannot change systems/data
- availablity - that the system is available

- non-repudiantion : not sending the same message multiple times
- authen / autho : who and what can they do
  
### Vurnabilities / Weaknesses
- owasp
- cwe

## Security frameworks and standards
- gdpr etc

### What is a standart
- a set of requirement we should adhere to
- ISO (org International standard org or something) produces standards

- discussion security vs compliance

## MITRE ATT&CK framework
- libary of real world examples of data breaches and attacks
- different types of attacks 
- good for inspiration for attacks


## Ethical hacking methodology
- kill chain
- SANS : pen testing methods (se slide 49)

## Pen testing report
- get inspo on google
- (pci org - se slides) template

## Intro to Kali Linux
- made for pen-test
