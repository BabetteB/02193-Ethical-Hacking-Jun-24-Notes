# Passive Reconnaissance

## Reconnaissance
- the first step of the kill chain- 
- gain information that can be weponised
- active is an interaction with the target and might become visible
- passive is without interacting with the target
  - we use open source intelligense
  - do whatever everyone else does / can do
  - hide our existance as much as possible
  - a single thing (that can look like an accident) is not a problem - but repeated are
  - sus alert if you touch a honeypot : is attractive to an attacker
    - alerts that somebody touched me
    - might want to keep you interacted, such that the attacker might be traceable or might reveal what they want
- atcive : uses tool, scan ports, find info etc (see tommorrow)  

### Passive Rec
- use open sources of information
- osin (open source intelligence)
- businesses needs to register
- google stores everything that is on the web
  - so you can look at googles info without alerting the actual page

**focus/goal**
- to find information that is useful and then how to weponize
- e.g. if you want to do a social engineering attack, you need to find out how
- psycical 
  - e.g. layout, protection on the server room,
  - get information about their systems, get a hieracy in services
  - web lageret
  - streetview
  - e.g. social engineering : you can talegate a worker if they smoke by turning up at the smoking area
- logical : software modules, packages, services etc
  - looking for
    - assets : the things we are trying to attack
    - org : their structure and processes
    - infrastructure: connecting to any server it will probably say something about what it is
      - having access to log files MIGHT have interesting info, e.g. debug info
- human : use directly towards the target
- banners often display what server it has etc
- common vulnability database
- Beacon - mac address is source

## Maltego
- standart tool to document reconnances steps
- bit of info you know and connect them
- limited in the free version

## Shodan
- to find possible vulnabilities
- not free
- register with dtu mail then 10%

**LOOK FOR JOBPOSTINGS!!!**
- use different browsers

## Assignment
- Pick an attack e.g. CEO attack
- then find open source information about them
- i found this information, this is how i would weponize it 
- take screenshots
